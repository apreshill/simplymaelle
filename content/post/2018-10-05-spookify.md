It’s October, time for spooky Twitter names! If you’re on this social
media platform, you might have noticed some of your friends switching
their names to something spooky and punny. Last year I was “Maelstrom
Salmon”, which I find scary but is arguably not that funny. Anyhow, what
if you want to switch your name but have no inspiration? In this post,
we shall explore R’s abilities to help us with that with the help of
webscraping, phonetic spelling and string distance algorithms, and the
magic of randomness!

<!--more-->
My strategy for spooky name generation will be to replace each part of a
name (e.g. first and last names) with the phonetically closest
Halloween-related words. Therefore, the technical challenges here were
to find a list of Halloween-related words, and to measure *phonetical*
string distance.

Getting spooky words
====================

The [otherwise very useful](https://masalmon.eu/tags/rcorpora/) package
[`rcorpora`](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/rcorpora) doesn’t have a
“spooky” category, so I decided to scrape [this webpage of Halloween
words for
kids](https://holidappy.com/holidays/halloween-words-and-halloween-vocabulary-lists).
It was one of the first search results, and being for kids it couldn’t
be offensive. Like the last two times I webscraped, I used the [very
cool](https://masalmon.eu/2018/07/31/alldatascience/)
[`polite`](https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite) package!

There were two less useful sections on the page, with French and Spanish
words, that I very inelegantly removed after looking up their div ID in
the page source.

``` r
# introduce myself
session <- polite::bow("https://holidappy.com/holidays/halloween-words-and-halloween-vocabulary-lists",
                       user_agent = "Maëlle Salmon https://masalmon.eu/")

# scrape
page <- polite::scrape(session)
```

    ## No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.

``` r
# remove the two sections I don't want
French <- xml2::xml_find_all(page,
                            xpath = "//div[@id='mod_37589248']")

xml2::xml_remove(French)

Spanish <- xml2::xml_find_all(page,
                              xpath = "//div[@id='mod_37589143']")

xml2::xml_remove(Spanish)

# extract the words
words <- xml2::xml_find_all(page,
                            xpath = "//td[contains(@class, 'tableCell')]")

words <- xml2::xml_text(words)
head(words)
```

    ## [1] "All Hallows' Eve\n\t" "lantern\n\t"          "prank\n\t"           
    ## [4] "costume\n\t"          "make-believe\n\t"     "sweets\n\t"

I cleaned the words a bit. Some of them were not *words* so I split
them. I hesitated between this solution and keeping only one-word
phrases… I’m still not sure it was the best decision!

``` r
words <- stringr::str_remove_all(words, "\\\n\\\t")
words <- trimws(words)
words <- tokenizers::tokenize_words(words)
words <- unlist(words[lengths(words) > 0])
words <- words[!stringr::str_detect(words, "[0-9]")]
head(words)
```

    ## [1] "all"     "hallows" "eve"     "lantern" "prank"   "costume"

I obtained 258 words.

Matching names and spooky words
===============================

Once I had this vector of Halloween-related words, all I needed was a
way to compute a phonetical distance between each of them and a name. It
turned out more complicated than I thought! The `soundex` method of the
[`stringdist`](https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist) package
returned 1 or 0 only, so I set out to search another package supporting
phonetical comparison. I found the
[`phonics`](https://github.com/howardjp/phonics) package that has a
paper in JOSS, that implements more algorithms translating strings to
phonetic “codes”. I ended up using the `phonics::nysiis()` function,
corresponding to the New York State Identification and Intelligence
System phonetic algorithm. That package also has an algorithm suitable
for German, via `phonics::cologne()`, and one for French, via
`phonics::statcan()`, but I haven’t explored that further.

``` r
phonics::nysiis("pain")
```

    ## [1] "PAN"

``` r
phonics::nysiis("pane")
```

    ## [1] "PAN"

``` r
phonics::nysiis("train")
```

    ## [1] "TRAN"

I was at a loss as to how best compare output from `phonics::nysiis()`
and very hackily used… `stringdist::stringdist()` with a default method!
Below is the function finding the closest match for any name part.

``` r
spookify_word <- function(word, seed = 42, words){

  phon <- phonics::nysiis(words)
  dist <- stringdist::stringdist(phonics::nysiis(word),
                                 phon)
  set.seed(seed)
  sample(words[dist == min(dist)], 1)
}
spookify_word("Jane", words = words)
```

    ## [1] "bones"

So `spookify_word()` samples a word among the closest matches… that
aren’t necessarily very close to the original name. But that’s fine!

Mixing it all in a ~~chauldron~~ function
=========================================

I finally created a function taking a whole name, say “Maëlle Salmon” or
“Ada Colau Ballano”, tokenizes it into words thanks to the
[`tokenizers`](https://github.com/ropensci/tokenizers) package, gets the
closest match for each part and then collapses everything together,
capitalizing first letters thanks to
[`snakecase`](https://github.com/Tazinho/snakecase)… before announcing
the result with the cool [`cowsay`](https://github.com/sckott/cowsay)
package! I made sure to only use animals that are associated with
Halloween.

``` r
spookify <- function(name, seed,
                     words){
  name_parts <- unlist(tokenizers::tokenize_words(name))
  spook_names <- purrr::map_chr(name_parts,
                                spookify_word,
                                seed, words)
  spook_name <- paste(spook_names, collapse = " ")
  spook_name <- snakecase::to_upper_camel_case(spook_name,
                                               sep_out =  " ")
  
  set.seed(seed)
  animal <- sample(c("owl", "spider",
                     "pumpkin", "ghost",
                     "bat"), 1)

  cowsay::say(what = paste0("Byebye ", name, "\n",
                           "You are now ", spook_name),
              by = animal)

}
```

And because I didn’t want to make fun of anyone else than me, I created
7 fake names using the `charlatan` package and ran `spookify` on them!

``` r
set.seed(42)
names <- charlatan::ch_name(n = 7)
purrr::walk2(names, 1:length(names),
             spookify, words = words)
```

Note that [I reported the message I got from
`cowsay`](https://github.com/sckott/cowsay/issues/65). It’s not too bad,
`cowsay` is not designed for use in R Markdown I think.

I found the results not fantastic, but not too bad either! I especially
liked “Boogers Party”!

Mucus, anyone?
==============

In conclusion, in this post I showed how to build a corpus of
Halloween-related words by responsibly webscraping, and how to more or
less hackily compare strings based on their pronunciation. I obviously
tried the function on my own name (without the accent, useless in this
case) and wasn’t too happy…

``` r
spookify("Maelle Salmon", 42, words)
```

But then, at least, it *is* scary.
