What can a kaka, a kakapo, an European rabbit and a grey heron have in
common? Well, they might co-habit in the bookshelf of an R user, since
they’re all animals on the covers of popular R books: [“R
Packages”](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), [“R for Data
Science”](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), [“Text mining with
R”](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) and [“Efficient R
programming”](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/), respectively.
Their publisher, O’Reilly, has now based its brand on covers featuring
beautiful gravures of animals.

Recently, while wondering what the name of R for Data Science bird was
again (I thought it was a kea!), I was thrilled to find [the whole
O’Reilly menagerie](https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp), i.e. a list of
books and corresponding animals! The website also features a link to [“A
short history of the O’Reilly
animals”](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/a-short-history-of-the-oreilly-animals)
that was an amazing read. In it was noted that “The animals are in
trouble.”, with a few examples of endangered species. It inspired me to
actually try and assess the conservation status of O’Reilly animals
using responsible webscraping, taxonomic name resolving and IUCN Redlist
API querying…

Scraping the menagerie: an utter delight!
=========================================

I had a great time webscraping the menagerie, not only thanks to my now
reasonable experience doing such things, but also thanks to

-   my using the [wonderful `polite` package for
    webscraping](https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite), that makes me feel
    so good about myself. Read more about this package [in my previous
    post](https://masalmon.eu/2018/07/31/alldatascience/).

-   the webpage having really good structured html with specific
    classes.

The menagerie is divided into pages of 20 books, so I mapped over all
possible offsets up to the number of animals indicated on the website,
1227.

``` r
library("magrittr")
home_url <- "https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp"

session <- polite::bow(home_url,
                       user_agent = "Maëlle Salmon https://masalmon.eu/")

get_twenty <- function(offset, session){
  # offset parameter to get all books 20 by 20
  params <- glue::glue("?x-o={offset}")
  
  # scraping with content parameter
  # cf https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite/issues/6
  # https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp?x-o=720 was problematic
  # (German characters)
  page <- polite::scrape(session, params = params, 
                         content = "text/html;charset=iso-8859-1")
  # get all animal rows
  rows <- rvest::xml_nodes(page,
                           xpath = "//div[@class='animal-row']")
  # extract book titles
  rows %>%
    rvest::xml_nodes(xpath = "a[@class='book']") %>%
    rvest::xml_nodes(xpath = "h1[@class='book-title']") %>%
    rvest::html_text() -> book_titles
  
  rows %>%
    rvest::xml_nodes(xpath = "h2[@class='animal-name']") %>%
    rvest::html_text() -> animal_names
  
  tibble::tibble(book = book_titles,
                 animal = animal_names)
  
}

no_animals <- 1227 # by hand!

offsets <- (0:floor(no_animals/20))*20

purrr::map_df(offsets, get_twenty, session = session) %>%
  readr::write_csv("oreilly_animals.csv")
  
```

I got 1134 rows, each corresponding to a book, with animals potentially
repeated.

``` r
animals
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,134 x 2
    ##    book                            animal                                 
    ##    <chr>                           <chr>                                  
    ##  1 Mobile Design and Development   12-Wired Bird of Paradise              
    ##  2 Windows PowerShell for Develop~ 3-Banded Armadillo                     
    ##  3 Jakarta Commons Cookbook        Aardvark                               
    ##  4 Clojure Cookbook                Aardwolf

    ##  6 Social eCommerce                Adjutant (Storks)                      
    ##  7 BioBuilder                      Aegina Citrea, narcomedusae, jellyfish 
    ##  8 JRuby Cookbook                  African Civet                          
    ##  9 C# 5.0 Pocket Reference         African Crowned Crane aka Grey Crowned~
    ## 10 Programming C# 5.0              African Crowned Crane aka Grey Crowned~
    ## # ... with 1,124 more rows

In the short history of animals, Edie Freedman mentions having
discovered “that there were intriguing correspondences between specific
technologies and specific animals”. This made me curious about my last
name, Salmon!

``` r
animals %>%
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(animal, "[Ss]almon")) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| book                                    | animal  |
|:----------------------------------------|:--------|
| Values, Units, and Colors               | Salmon  |
| CSS Text                                | Salmon  |
| CSS Fonts                               | Salmon  |
| Selectors, Specificity, and the Cascade | Salmon  |
| Transitions and Animations in CSS       | Salmon2 |

I have no idea what trait of salmons make them good at design, other
than my not sharing that trait with them. When my friend Adrien and I
wrote [a (non O’Reilly)
book](https://www.editions-ellipses.fr/product_info.php?products_id=7159)
years ago, we selected a frog for the cover based on its being pretty,
which is much less cool than O’Reilly branding!

From animals common names to scientific names?
==============================================

Now, you’ll have noticed the names of animals are written in English. My
ultimate goal being the querying of IUCN Red List API, and this API only
accepting scientific names (contrary to the website of the same
organization), I needed to resolve the common names to scientific names.
This is a hard problem! My strategy here was:

-   Cleaning the names a bit to remove the parts after “aka” for
    instance.

``` r
clean <- function(animal){
  semiclean <- animal %>%
    stringr::str_remove_all("aka.*") %>%
    stringr::str_remove_all("\\,.*") %>%
    stringr::str_remove_all("\\(.*") 
  
  if(semiclean == "12-Wired Bird of Paradise"){
    semiclean <- "Twelve-Wired Bird of Paradise"
  }
  
  if(semiclean == "3-Banded Armadillo"){
    semiclean <- "Three-Banded Armadillo"
  }
  stringr::str_remove_all(semiclean, "[0-9]")
}


animals <- dplyr::mutate(animals, animal_clean = purrr::map_chr(animal, clean))
```

-   Using the [rOpenSci `taxize`
    package](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize) that has a handy
    `comm2sci` function. This function works for anyone, but it’s better
    to request a key for the database used, EOL by default (see e.g.
    `taxize::use_eol()` for more info).

-   Not being too optimistic since the databases `taxize` queries cannot
    do wonders, no matter how good they are.

Note that for each species, the first scientific name returned is
selected, because there’s no other criterion to go by. That’s how I’ll
end up with a Salmon catfish for Salmon, too bad.

``` r
animal_names <- unique(animals$animal_clean)

# scientific names
good_comm2sci <- memoise::memoise(taxize::comm2sci)

get_name <- function(common_name){
  sci_names <- good_comm2sci(common_name)
  
  # don't get the name of who defined the species
  sci_name <- stringr::word(sci_names[[1]][1], start=1, end = 2)
  
  tibble::tibble(common_name = common_name,
                 sci_name = sci_name)
}
scientific_names <- purrr::map_df(animal_names, get_name)

animals <- dplyr::left_join(animals,
                            scientific_names,
                            by = c("animal_clean" = "common_name"))
```

I got names for 694 books, out of 1134, getting 555 animals. It’s not
bad, but this number also needs to be treated with caution. See for
instance:

``` r
animals %>%
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(animal, "Galapagos")) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| book               | animal                | animal\_clean         | sci\_name          |
|:-------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:-------------------|
| PHP Cookbook       | Galapagos Land Iguana | Galapagos Land Iguana | Conolophus marthae |
| Upgrading to PHP 5 | Galapagos Tortoise    | Galapagos Tortoise    | Chelonoidis nigra  |

I noticed the iguana while perusing my results, and a quick internet
search taught me that there are *three* species of terrestrial iguanas
in the Galapagos, the most common one, and the one probably present on
the book cover, being Conolophus subcristatus, not Conolophus marthae!
I’ve noticed a few other mistakes, so I’ll need to handle the results
with care. I now wish the menagerie had a bit more Latin in it!

Querying the IUCN Red List
==========================

Indeed, scientific names of species are the key to a wealth of data!
[Traits data](https://github.com/ropensci/traits), [taxonomic
information](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize)… and conservation
status thanks to the [IUCN Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/), an
impressive assessment of species at the global scale. One can
programmatically query it using the [rOpenSci `rredlist`
package](https://github.com/ropensci/traits)! That’s what I did, adding
a waiting time of 2 seconds between API calls, [as recommended by the
IUCN folks](https://github.com/ropensci/rredlist#rate-limiting). Note
that I have an API key because I asked for it, see more info by typing
`rredlist::rl_use_iucn()` after installing `rredlist`, and be patient
since it can last a few days before one gets one.

``` r
slow_rl_search <- ratelimitr::limit_rate(rredlist::rl_search,
                                         rate = ratelimitr::rate(1, 2))

get_status <- function(sci_name){
  message(sci_name)
  results <- slow_rl_search(sci_name)$result
  
  if(!is.null(results)){
    results$sci_name <- sci_name
  }
  
  results
}

animals <- dplyr::filter(animals, !is.na(sci_name))
purrr::map_df(unique(animals$sci_name), get_status) %>%
  readr::write_csv("oreilly_animals_status.csv")
```

``` r
status <- readr::read_csv("oreilly_animals_status.csv")

animals <- readr::read_csv("oreilly_animals_scientific.csv")

status <- dplyr::filter(status, !is.na(category))
animals <- dplyr::left_join(animals, status, by = "sci_name")

str(animals)
```

There are 1134 books, 499 with a conservation status from the IUCN Red
List, although this includes “DD” meaning “Data Deficient”. I am
hesitant to actually show the proportion of species in each category for
those for which I got data for, because the resolution of common names
to scientific names isn’t certain… Take the following table with a pinch
of salt!

``` r
dplyr::count(animals, category) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| category |    n|
|:---------|----:|
| CR       |   14|
| DD       |    7|
| EN       |   42|
| EW       |    1|
| EX       |    6|
| LC       |  348|
| LR/cd    |    1|
| LR/lc    |    5|
| LR/nt    |    4|
| NT       |   23|
| VU       |   48|
| NA       |  635|

See [the following page for more precise information about
categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List#IUCN_Red_List_Categories).
LC is least concern. Let’s have a look at the extinct species.

``` r
animals %>%
  dplyr::filter(category == "EX") %>%
  dplyr::select(book, animal, sci_name) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| book                                        | animal                                           | sci\_name            |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|:---------------------|
| Java Data Objects                           | Bilby, Rabbit-eared Bandicoot (Macrotis lagotis) | Macrotis leucura     |
| Building and Testing with Gradle            | Bush Wren                                        | Xenicus longipes     |
| Designing Mobile Payment Experiences        | Crested Pigeon                                   | Microgoura meeki     |
| SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide | Land Snail                                       | Amastra crassilabrum |
| Java NIO                                    | Pigfooted Bandicoot                              | Chaeropus ecaudatus  |
| Java I/O                                    | White Rabbit                                     | Macrotis leucura     |

I searched for the covers and names and could assess that in that table,
there are 4 false positives due to the ambiguity of common names! Only
the Bush wren and the Pigfooted Bandicoot got scientific names
corresponding to what they look like, and are extinct, which is quite
sad.

Now, to reverse-engineer what Edie Freeman wrote in the short history of
O’Reilly animals, “Many of the animals that appear on our covers are
critically endangered—the tarsier from Learning the vi & Vim Editors,
the lorises from sed & awk, the Hawksbill turtle from Getting Started
with CouchDB, the tiger from Running Mac OS X Tiger, and the African
elephant on Hadoop: The Definitive Guide, just to name a few.”, let’s
look at what we got for them.

``` r
animals %>%
  dplyr::filter(book %in%
                  c("Hadoop: The Definitive Guide",
                    "Learning the vi and Vim Editors",
                    "sed & awk",
                    "Getting Started with CouchDB",
                    "Running Mac OS X Tiger")) %>%
  dplyr::select(book, animal, sci_name, category) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| book                            | animal                                                   | sci\_name              | category |
|:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------|
| Hadoop: The Definitive Guide    | African Elephant, young                                  | Elephantulus rozeti    | LC       |
| Getting Started with CouchDB    | Hawksbill Turtle                                         | Eretmochelys imbricata | CR       |
| sed & awk                       | Slender Loris “Awk”                                      | NA                     | NA       |
| Running Mac OS X Tiger          | Sumatran Tiger                                           | Parantica tityoides    | LR/nt    |
| Learning the vi and Vim Editors | Tarsier, full-body, standing on hind feet, b/w engraving | Tarsius pelengensis    | EN       |

Again, our name resolution wasn’t very good!

-   The elephant should be Loxondota africana, [vulnerable
    species](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12392/0)

-   The turtle is right.

-   For the loris we should have gotten [this
    species](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12375/0) that’s
    endangered.

-   The Sumatran tiger, Panthera tigris ssp. sumatrae , is [critically
    endangered](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15966/0)

-   There are several Tarsier species, I’m not sure which one is the
    right one.

So all in all, we got some truth but also some wrong names and hence
wrong conservation statuses!

Conclusion: hoping for a menagerie of scientific names
======================================================

In this post, I exemplified responsible webscraping with the use of [the
`polite` package](https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite) to get a table of
all animals on O’Reilly book covers from the dedicated menagerie. I
tried resolving the common names to scientific names using
[`taxize::comm2sci`](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize), which was only
partly successful. I got conservation status for the scientific names
using the [`rredlist` package](https://github.com/ropensci/rredlist),
programmatic interface to the IUCN Red List. The results would be better
if O’Reilly published scientific names of animals, but nonetheless this
workflow helped me identify two extinct species, the Bush wren of
[Building and Testing with
Gradle](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920019909.do) and the
Pigfooted Bandicoot of [Java
NIO](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596002886.do). I can’t but hope
the list of such now sad book covers won’t grow any longer…
